## History

Numerical Analysis and Theoretical Computer Science 

Over the past several years, there has been a concerted effort to 


[eNLA seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/e-nla/home)

this has resulted in a concerted effort to bridge some of the gaps between these communities. 

in a workshop at 
[Banff International Research Station](https://www.birs.ca/events/2023/5-day-workshops/23w5108/participants) and a semseter-long program at the [Simons--Institute](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/complexity-linear-algebra)

## Algorithmic Design Philosophy

Many algorithms in RandNLA only use randomness to guarantee a given sketching matrix is a [subspace embedding](../Sketching/subspace-embedding.ipynb).
The analyses of such algorithms is broken into two steps:
- Show conditions under which a sketching matrix is a subspace embedding.
- Show that the algorithm is correct when the sketching matrix is a subspace embedding.

This type of algorithms are modular, because the choice of sketching matrix can be changed to better suit the user's needs.  -->
