# Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra

Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) is a subfield of numerical linear algebra that focuses on the use of randomization as a tool to develop more efficient algorithms for solving linear algebra problems.
Many RandNLA algorithms are remarkably simple, while providing significant speedups over traditional methods.

This "book" aims to provide a practical introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques in RandNLA through simple mathematical explanations and accompanying code examples.
We focus on intuition and ~vibes~, leaving comprehensive treatments to existing literature. 




## Prerequisites

Readers are expected to be familiar with (numerical) linear algebra.
We assume readers have a basic understanding of matrix factorizations (e.g. QR, SVD, etc.) and concepts like stability and conditioning.
A basic overview is provided [here](../Background/review.ipynb)


## Other Resources

There are many existing resources on RandNLA.
