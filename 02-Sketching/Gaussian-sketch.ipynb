    "We say a matrix $\\vec{G} \\in \\R^{k \\times n}$ is a Gaussian matrix if its entries are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from a standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Gaussian matrix can be applied to $\\vec{A}$ in $O(ndk)$ operations.\n",
    "In a number of applications we require $k \\geq d$, so the cost of applying $\\vec{S}$ to $\\vec{A}$ will exceed the cost of the downstream application. \n",
    "However, even in such cases, Gaussian sketching matrices play an important role in RandNLA. \n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, the behavior of algorithms when other sketching distributions are used closely mimics the Gaussian case.\n",
    "However, owing to the many nice properties of Gaussian matrices, it is often easier to analyze the performance of algorithms using Gaussian sketches."
