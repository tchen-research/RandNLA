In [Chapter 4](../05-Low-Rank-Approximation/low-rank-approximation.md) we discuss algorithms for obtaining a [low-rank aprpoxiamtion](task-low-rank) to $\vec{A}$.
These algorithms require one or more passes over the data-matrix $\vec{A}$.
Remarkably, in some settings, it is possible to obtain a good low-rank approximation *without even observing all of $\vec{A}$*.
